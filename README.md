Neural Network test programs

Regarding neuralNet:
This neural network was created by following the lesson plan within "Make Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid. It served as a basic teaching tool of how a simple neural network can operate. The network itself is designed to read hand-written numbers and identify those numbers correctly. I do not claim ownership of any of these ideas presented within this particular program. It serves simply as a tutorial for stepping into neural network development.
